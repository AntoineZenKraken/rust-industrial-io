# Rust Bindings to _libiio_

These bindings were auto-generated by _bindgen_.

To create bindings for a new version of the library, first install _llnm_ and _bindgen:_

```
$ sudo apt install llvm
$ cargo install bindgen
```

The run bindgen over the library's single header file, _iio.h_, like this:_

```
$  bindgen iio.h > bindings-0.18.rs
```
Then update the _build.rs_ or _lib.rs_ files in this crate to use the new version.
